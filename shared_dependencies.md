Shared Dependencies:

1. Markdown Syntax: All files are in markdown format, so they share the common syntax of markdown for formatting text, creating tables, adding links, etc.

2. Use Case Format: Each use case file will follow a similar structure, including sections for the use case explanation, implementation example, and pros and cons. This structure can be considered a shared schema.

3. Table of Contents Links: The table_of_contents.md file will contain links to all the use case files. These links are shared dependencies as they need to match the file names and paths of the use case files.

4. Use Case Titles: The titles of the use cases are shared between the table of contents file and the individual use case files. They need to be consistent for navigation purposes.

5. Emojis and Jokes: These elements will be used throughout the use case files to make the content more entertaining. The specific emojis and jokes used could be considered shared dependencies if they are reused across multiple files.

6. GitHub Repository Structure: The structure of the GitHub repository is a shared dependency. All use case files are stored in the "use_cases" directory, and this path is shared across all files.

7. README.md File: This file will likely contain an overview of the repository and instructions for navigating the use cases. It may share some content with the table of contents file and the use case files, such as the use case titles.

Note: As this is a markdown-based GitHub repository, there are no exported variables, DOM elements, message names, or function names involved.
