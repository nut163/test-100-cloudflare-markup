# Use Case 94: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

## Explanation

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. With Cloudflare Workers, you can easily implement A/B testing by routing traffic to different versions of your site.

## Implementation Example

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  const VARIANT_A = 'https://variant-a.example.com'
  const VARIANT_B = 'https://variant-b.example.com'

  let group = (Math.random() < 0.5) ? 'A' : 'B' // 50/50 split

  let url = group === 'A' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B

  let response = await fetch(url)

  // Set cookie to track user
  response = new Response(response.body, response)
  response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)

  return response
}
```

## Pros

1. Cloudflare Workers allow you to implement A/B testing at the edge, reducing latency and improving user experience.
2. You can easily adjust the traffic split between variants.
3. The use of cookies allows you to ensure that a user sees the same variant on repeat visits.

## Cons

1. Implementing A/B testing with Cloudflare Workers requires some knowledge of JavaScript.
2. You need to manage and monitor the performance of your variants.
