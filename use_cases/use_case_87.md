# Use Case 87: Implementing a Custom Cache with Cloudflare Workers

In this use case, we will explore how to implement a custom cache using Cloudflare Workers. This can be useful when you want to have more control over how your content is cached and served to your users. 😎

## Explanation

Cloudflare Workers allows you to write JavaScript code that runs on Cloudflare's edge servers. This means you can modify your site's HTTP requests and responses, make parallel requests, or generate responses from the edge.

One of the powerful features of Cloudflare Workers is the ability to interact with the Cache API. This allows you to customize how your content is cached, giving you more control over your cache behavior.

## Implementation Example

Here's a simple example of how you can implement a custom cache with Cloudflare Workers:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  let response = await caches.default.match(request)

  if (!response) {
    response = await fetch(request)
    const cacheTime = response.headers.get('Cache-Control')
    if (cacheTime) {
      let cacheDuration = cacheTime.match(/max-age=(\d+)/)
      if (cacheDuration) {
        let time = parseInt(cacheDuration[1])
        if (time > 0) {
          response = new Response(response.body, response)
          response.headers.append('Cache-Control', `public, max-age=${time}`)
          event.waitUntil(caches.default.put(request, response.clone()))
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return response
}
```

This script first checks if a cached response is available for the incoming request. If not, it fetches the response from the origin server and checks the 'Cache-Control' header. If the 'max-age' directive is present and greater than 0, it caches the response with the specified max-age.

## Pros and Cons

Pros:
1. Gives you more control over your cache behavior.
2. Can improve performance by serving cached content from the edge.
3. Can reduce costs by reducing the number of requests to your origin server.

Cons:
1. Requires knowledge of JavaScript and the Cache API.
2. If not implemented correctly, can lead to stale or incorrect content being served.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use the Cache API wisely! 😄
