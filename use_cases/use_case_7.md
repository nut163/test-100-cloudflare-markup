# Use Case 7: Implementing A/B Testing with Cloudflare Workers

## Explanation

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. With Cloudflare Workers, you can easily implement A/B testing by routing traffic to different versions of your site.

## Implementation Example

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`__cf_worker_ab_test`)) {
    return fetch(request) // Use existing variant
  } else {
    // Determine variant, set cookie, and fetch
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B'
    const newRequest = new Request(request)
    newRequest.headers.append('Cookie', `__cf_worker_ab_test=${group}`)
    return fetch(newRequest)
  }
}
```

## Pros

1. Easy to implement: With just a few lines of code, you can start A/B testing your site.
2. Scalable: Cloudflare Workers can handle high traffic volumes, making it suitable for large-scale A/B testing.
3. Real-time: Changes are applied instantly, allowing you to quickly iterate and improve your site.

## Cons

1. Limited to HTTP/HTTPS traffic: Cloudflare Workers can only handle HTTP/HTTPS requests, so you can't use it for A/B testing non-web applications.
2. Cost: While Cloudflare Workers is relatively affordable, costs can add up if you have a lot of traffic or complex scripts.
