# Use Case 55: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

## Explanation

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. With Cloudflare Workers, you can easily implement A/B testing by routing traffic to different versions of your site.

## Implementation Example

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  const VARIANT_A = 'https://variant-a.example.com'
  const VARIANT_B = 'https://variant-b.example.com'

  let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B' // 50/50 split
  let url = group === 'A' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B

  let response = await fetch(url)
  response = new Response(response.body, response)
  response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)

  return response
}
```

This script listens for fetch events, and when a request is made, it randomly assigns the user to group A or B. It then fetches the appropriate variant and returns it as the response.

## Pros

1. Easy to implement: With just a few lines of code, you can set up A/B testing on your site.
2. Flexible: You can adjust the percentage of users who see each variant by changing the split in the `Math.random()` function.
3. Fast: Because Cloudflare Workers operate at the edge, the user's experience is not slowed down by this testing.

## Cons

1. Limited to HTTP traffic: Cloudflare Workers can only handle HTTP requests, so this method of A/B testing won't work for other types of traffic.
2. Cookie reliance: This method relies on cookies to assign users to a group, which may not work if a user has cookies disabled.
