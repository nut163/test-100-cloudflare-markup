# Use Case 25: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

## Explanation

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. With Cloudflare Workers, you can easily implement A/B testing by routing traffic to different versions of your site.

## Implementation Example

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  const VARIANT_A = 'https://variant-a.example.com'
  const VARIANT_B = 'https://variant-b.example.com'

  let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B' // 50/50 split
  let url = group === 'A' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B

  let response = await fetch(url)
  response = new Response(response.body, response)
  response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)

  return response
}
```

This script randomly sends users to either `VARIANT_A` or `VARIANT_B` and sets a cookie to remember which variant they saw.

## Pros

1. Easy to implement: With just a few lines of code, you can start A/B testing your site.
2. Flexible: You can adjust the percentage of traffic going to each variant by changing the split in the `group` variable.
3. Scalable: Cloudflare Workers can handle high traffic volumes, making it suitable for large-scale A/B tests.

## Cons

1. Limited to HTTP(S) requests: Cloudflare Workers operate at the edge, which means they can only modify HTTP(S) requests and responses. If your A/B test involves server-side logic, you'll need to implement it elsewhere.
2. Cookie reliance: This implementation relies on cookies to remember which variant a user saw. If a user has cookies disabled, they might see a different variant on each visit.
