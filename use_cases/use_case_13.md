# Use Case 13: Implementing a Serverless API with Cloudflare Workers

## Explanation

In this use case, we will explore how to implement a serverless API using Cloudflare Workers. This can be a cost-effective and scalable solution for many applications. ðŸ˜Ž

## Implementation Example

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  let path = url.pathname
  let response

  switch (path) {
    case '/api/data':
      response = new Response(JSON.stringify({data: 'Hello, World!'}), {
        headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      })
      break
    default:
      response = new Response('Not found', { status: 404 })
  }

  return response
}
```

This simple example shows how to create a serverless API that responds with a JSON object when the `/api/data` endpoint is hit. 

## Pros

1. **Scalability**: Cloudflare Workers are globally distributed and can scale up to meet demand.
2. **Cost-effective**: You only pay for what you use, making it a cost-effective solution for APIs with variable traffic.

## Cons

1. **Cold start latency**: While generally minimal, there can be a slight delay when a worker is first invoked after a period of inactivity.
2. **Limited CPU time**: Each request has a limited amount of CPU time, which can be a constraint for CPU-intensive tasks.
